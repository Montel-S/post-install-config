Here you can see that a supreme admin. role has been created. Adding roles can only be done as a administriator on the admin panel. The supreme admin. role basically gives the user complete control over all the settings inside the ticketing system. A role such as this is taylored towards a manager or supervisor position. The agent panel is less complicated and mainly only used for opening and solving tickets.
